# SNOOPY FACE ðŸ˜Ž

This is a simple face recognition angular application to test the [FaceAPI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vladmandic/face-api) with the help of [TensorFlow.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs) which is an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.

In this project I use a pre-trained FaceAPI model `mtcnn` which generously provides methods like `detectSingleFace`, `withFaceLandmarks`, `withFaceExpressions` to handle face detection in the easiest way possible; It even gives us the coordinates of different points for each face part.

so I calculate the (almost) proper eyes locations in the camera live stream and add Snoop Dogg meme sunglasses to the face. by default, you can see the face area, face landmarks and impressions and you can toggle them to see only yourself in the famous glasses B-)
